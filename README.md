Files Encryptor

This tool is designed for encrypting your local disk files with sha1 hex using a password. This password is then used to decrypt the file. For better remembrance of the password , a hint file is also generated in which the hint for the password can be put.
the encryption and decrytion occurs in the currennt directory and also recursively in the subdirectories.
an exe genereated from launch4j is also provided for the windows lovers howvere as it is in java it can be easily executed in linux or any other other operating system. 
 Currently the program doesnt show the progress, may be in future i will change it to adapt to it and the multithreading too, but it works perfectly fine and feel free to fork it and give it a run.
